Objective:
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for retrieving project data from Azure DevOps using REST APIs, extracting environment information for each project, gathering array variables, retrieving run data of deployments, structuring the data, and saving it to a storage account.

Introduction:

Purpose and Scope:
This documentation is intended to guide users through the process of retrieving project data from Azure DevOps, extracting environment information, gathering array variables, retrieving run data of deployments, structuring the data, and saving it to an Azure Storage Account. It is useful for developers, data analysts, and anyone working with Azure DevOps data.

Prerequisites:
Before following these steps, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Access to an Azure DevOps account.

Personal Access Token (PAT) for Azure DevOps API authentication.

Access to an Azure Storage Account where data will be saved.

Step 1: Retrieve Project Data from Azure DevOps:

Description:
This step involves using REST APIs to fetch a list of all projects from Azure DevOps.

Detailed Steps:

Obtain API Authentication (PAT Token):
Before making API requests to Azure DevOps, obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication. Follow the Azure DevOps documentation on creating a PAT if you don't have one.

Make a GET Request to Azure DevOps API to Retrieve Project Data:
Use your PAT token to make a GET request to the Azure DevOps API endpoint to retrieve a list of all projects. Store the project data for further processing.

Output:
A list of projects retrieved from Azure DevOps.

Step 2: Retrieve Environment Information for Each Project:

Description:
For each project in the list obtained in Step 1, retrieve environment data from Azure DevOps.

Detailed Steps:

Iterate Through the List of Projects:
Iterate through the list of projects obtained in Step 1.

Make a GET Request to Azure DevOps API to Retrieve Environment Information for Each Project:
For each project, use the project information to make a GET request to the Azure DevOps API endpoint to retrieve environment data. Store the environment data for further processing.

Output:
Environment data for each project.

Step 3: Retrieve Array Variables for Each Environment:

Description:
For each environment retrieved in Step 2, fetch array variables.

Detailed Steps:

Iterate Through the List of Environments:
Iterate through the list of environment data obtained in Step 2.

Make a GET Request to Azure DevOps API to Retrieve Array Variables for Each Environment:
For each environment, use the environment information to make a GET request to the Azure DevOps API endpoint to retrieve array variables. Store the array variables for further processing.

Output:
Array variables for each environment.

Step 4: Retrieve Run Data of Deployments:

Description:
For each environment retrieved in Step 2, fetch run data of deployments.

Detailed Steps:

Iterate Through the List of Environments:
Iterate through the list of environment data obtained in Step 2.

Make a GET Request to Azure DevOps API to Retrieve Run Data of Deployments:
For each environment, use the environment information to make a GET request to the Azure DevOps API endpoint to retrieve run data of deployments. Store the run data for further processing.

Output:
Run data of deployments for each environment.

Step 5: Design Custom Data Structure and Save Data:

Description:
Design a custom data structure to organize the retrieved data and prepare it for storage.

Detailed Steps:

Define Data Structure:
Design a custom data structure that suits your project's needs. This structure should define how the retrieved data will be organized.

Organize and Format Data According to the Defined Structure:
Organize and format the retrieved data according to the custom data structure defined in the previous step.

Output:
Structured data ready for storage.

Step 6: Save Data to Azure Storage Account:

Description:
Store the structured data in an Azure Storage Account for future access and analysis.

Detailed Steps:

Connect to Azure Storage Account:
Use your Azure Storage Account credentials to connect to the storage account where the data will be saved.

Upload the Structured Data to Azure Storage(Azure BLOB Create):
Upload the structured data to a specific container or directory within your Azure Storage Account.

Output:
Data successfully saved to Azure Storage.

Conclusion:

Summary of the Documentation:
This documentation has provided a step-by-step guide for retrieving project data from Azure DevOps, extracting environment information, gathering array variables, retrieving run data of deployments, structuring the data, and saving it to an Azure Storage Account. By following these steps, you can efficiently collect and organize data from your Azure DevOps projects for future use.

Next Steps:
With the data now stored in Azure Storage, you can proceed to analyze, visualize, or use it for various purposes according to your project's requirements.
